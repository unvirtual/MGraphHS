 - Graph generation
 -
 - Given a node degree partition D = {(N_1,d_1),..,(N_k,d_k)) with d_1
 - >= d_2 >= ..  for N_i nodes of degree d_i, the graph is constructed
 - by finding all d_j arcs emerging from a node n \in N_j. Nodes are
 - organized in equivalence classes EC = {(NE_1, d_1) ... (NE_c,d_c)}
 - that represent interconnections between the same vertices and arcs
 - are formed between the elements of EC. Initially, EC = D. During
 - construction, EC is refined such that after determining the next
 - d_j connections from a node n_j, any two nodes are found in the
 - same EC_i only if they were in the same class before and were both
 - (not) connected to n_j. The possible permutations of m connections
 - from a vertex of degree d_i=m to vertices in EC are called
 - m-sequences
 -
 - The resulting list of integrals contains both connected and
 - disconnected graphs. Moreover, it still contains isomorphic graphs
 - and has to be filtered for a list of unique graphs.
 -
 - TODO: improve by checking for canonic adjacency matrices during
 -       construction
